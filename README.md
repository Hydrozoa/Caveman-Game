The Caveman Game
----------------

If you wish to design a map for this version, download the [Design.jar](https://github.com/downloads/eomprogramming/caveman-game-android/Level%20Design.jar) and email the generated code to him. :)

Notes to programmers:

* You can't use the normal `PrintStream`, use the `LogCat` (I hope you have the sdk :P)
* If your testing it on a device that isn't 480px by 800px you will probably have problems, be sure to tell me where they are.
  * ...And make sure you set it to USB debugging mode and allow unknown sources to install apps :D
